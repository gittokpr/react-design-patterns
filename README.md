# React Design Patterns

## Layout Components

React components that deal primarily with arranging other components on the page.

1. Split Screen
2. List and Items
3. Models

## Container Components

Components that take care of loading and managing data of their child components. The idea of container components is that our (child) components shouldn't know where their data is coming from.
